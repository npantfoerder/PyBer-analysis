# PyBer with Matplotlib

## Overview of the Analysis
### Purpose
The CEO of PyBer, a Python based ride-sharing app company, has asked for a compelling visualization of all the rideshare data from January to early May of 2019. This analysis will help PyBer improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affortability for under-served neighborhoods.

## Results
### Differences in Ride-Sharing Data
The summary DataFrame shows the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride, and average fare per driver for each type of city. There were 66 urban, 36 suburban, and 18 rural cities in the data. The total number of rides for each type of city matches what we might expect; the total of 1,625 rides in urban cities is the highest and the total of 125 rides in rural cities is the lowest. The total number of drivers and the total fares for each city type also follow this pattern. 

Rural cities have the highest average fare per ride ($34.62) and urban cities have the lowest ($24.53). The average fare per driver is also highest in rural cities ($55.49) and lowest in urban cities ($16.57).

*Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types*

*Ride-sharing data include the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type*

## Summary
### Business Recommendations
*Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types*
